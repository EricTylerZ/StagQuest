# StagQuest

StagQuest is a Web3 battleground to fight human trafficking—one choice at a time. Mint a Stag NFT on Base Sepolia, stake ETH, and commit to a 9-day novena of purity. Every day you resist porn, you strike at the $150B trafficking industry’s demand. Your Stag grows stronger, and your victories fund freedom.

## Why It Exists
40 million are trafficked—42% by family, 76% under 18. Porn drives this evil. StagQuest turns personal discipline into collective liberation, tracked onchain.

## How It Works
- **Mint a Stag**: Pay ≥0.0001 ETH to join the fight.
- **Start a Novena**: Pledge ETH (optional) and resist temptation for 9 days.
- **Track Progress**: Owners complete novenas based on your daily wins.
- **See Impact**: Each clean day weakens exploitation—your Stag’s family grows for each novena without porn.

## Setup
1. **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/EricTylerZ/StagQuest.git`
2. **Install**: `npm install`
3. **Run**: `npm run dev`
4. **Deploy**: `vercel --prod`

## Usage
- Connect MetaMask (Base Sepolia, chain ID 84532).
- Mint, start novenas, or (as owner) manage completions.

## Next Steps
- Daily novena prompts (7x/day) via Discord with response tracking.
- Base mainnet deployment for real-world impact.
