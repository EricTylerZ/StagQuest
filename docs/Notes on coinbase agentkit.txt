Making an AI Agent with a wallet connected. connecting AI to crypto.

Agentic commerce, whys it matter that an AI has a wallet?

Ai chatting with AIs... that's likely to happen soon... its already happening.

Agent to agent workers
onramp, storage, send/receive, earn, offramp

micro-transactions matter more for agentic commerce.... Where the emotional cost of paying for somehting of a person is far more costly. 
https 402 status code for payments, micro-transaction, paymment required... future exercise to figure out how this works. 

This makes sense that AIs will use to buy things with microtransactions since they dont have the same emotional cost to purchase things. 
easy to integrate into node.js

how can people prepare for onchain ai
#1 agent-kit, voice is more used as user interface..
#2 make it agent friendly, so that agents can easily get into things, etc. smart contracts publishable so ai agents can find . Instead of making it for humans, make it for AI tools
#3 Make APIs and docs AI-accessible
 Interesting.
